# Mobile Apps: Real Monetization

## Choose Your Model

| Model           | Best For                          | Reality Check                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Subscription    | Recurring value, habit apps       | 2-5% free→paid conversion typical  |
| IAP consumables | Games, AI credits                 | High volume needed                 |
| IAP unlock      | One-time features                 | Declining, but works for pro tools |
| Paid upfront    | Strong brand, niche pro           | Hard to compete with free          |
| Ads             | Millions of users, low engagement | $0.50-10 CPM, often disappointing  |

**Default to subscription** if your app provides ongoing value. But know: the "78% of App Store revenue is subscriptions" stat includes Netflix and Spotify. Indie reality is harder.

## Pricing That Makes $10K/month

The math most people get wrong:

| Price      | Apple Cut | You Get | Users Needed for $10K/mo |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| $2.99/mo   | 15%       | $2.54   | 3,937 active subs        |
| $4.99/mo   | 15%       | $4.24   | 2,358 active subs        |
| $9.99/mo   | 15%       | $8.49   | 1,178 active subs        |
| $6.99/week | 15%       | $5.94   | ~420 active subs\*       |

\*Weekly has higher churn but much higher ARPU. The "secret" of top-grossing apps.

## Weekly Pricing (The Uncomfortable Truth)

Top indie apps often use weekly:

- Impulse purchase (feels small)
- Filters to high-intent users
- Higher churn but 3-4x ARPU

**Structure that works:**

- $6.99/week (impulse buyers, ~40% of revenue)
- $9.99/month (comparison anchor)
- $59.99/year (best value, ~50% of revenue)
- $149.99 lifetime (whales, ~10% of revenue)

## Paywall Placement

| When                              | Conversion Rate       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| First screen                      | 1-2% (too aggressive) |
| After value demo (3-5 screens)    | 4-6%                  |
| When limit hit ("3/3 uses today") | 6-10%                 |

**Rule**: Show paywall AFTER the user experiences value. Not before.

## Paywall That Converts

Structure:

1. **Benefit headline** — "Unlock unlimited [thing]" not "Go Premium"
2. **3-4 outcomes** — What they GET, not feature list
3. **Social proof** — "Join 50,000+ users"
4. **Price** — Highlight annual, show per-day ("$0.27/day")
5. **CTA** — "Start Free Trial" not "Subscribe"
6. **Skip option** — Visible but subtle

Copy that works:

- ✗ "Upgrade to Premium"
- ✓ "Never miss a workout again"
- ✓ "Edit photos like a pro"

## Introductory Offers (Critical)

Set up in App Store Connect → Subscriptions → Intro Offers

| Offer Type                      | Best For                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Free trial (3-7 days)           | Complex apps needing time to show value |
| Pay up front ($0.99 first week) | Simple apps, filters tire-kickers       |

**Optimal setup:**

- Weekly: 3 days free OR $0.99 first week
- Monthly: 7 days free OR $1.99 first month
- Annual: 7 days free OR $9.99 first year

## RevenueCat Setup (Correct)

```dart
// pubspec.yaml: purchases_flutter: ^6.0.0

// Initialize
await Purchases.configure(
  PurchasesConfiguration('appl_your_key')
);

// Get offerings for paywall
final offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
if (offerings.current != null) {
  // Show paywall with offerings.current.availablePackages
}

// Make purchase
try {
  await Purchases.purchasePackage(package);
} on PurchasesErrorCode catch (e) {
  // Handle: userCancelled, paymentPending, etc.
}

// Check access anywhere
final info = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo();
bool isPro = info.entitlements.all['premium']?.isActive ?? false;
```

## A/B Testing

| Test           | Impact          | Min Sample    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Paywall timing | ±50% revenue    | 1,000/variant |
| Trial length   | ±30% conversion | 1,000/variant |
| Price point    | ±40% revenue    | 2,000/variant |
| CTA copy       | ±15%            | 500/variant   |

**Don't bother**: Button colors, icon changes.

## Platform Differences

|              | iOS             | Android              |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Commission   | 15% (<$1M), 30% | 15% (first $1M), 30% |
| Trial        | 3-30 days       | Min 3 days           |
| Grace period | 16 days         | 30 days              |
| Refunds      | Apple decides   | User gets 48h        |

**Action**: Set maximum grace period on both. Free retention.
