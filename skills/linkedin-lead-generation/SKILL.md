# LinkedIn Lead Generation & Research

This skill provides a structured workflow for identifying and verifying high-quality business leads.

## Workflow

1.  **Target Selection**: Define industries that need digital transformation but aren't tech-native (e.g., Textile, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Healthcare, Energy, D2C Brands).
2.  **LinkedIn Search**:
    - Use `browser` tool to search LinkedIn: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=founder+CEO+[Industry]+[Location]`
    - Filter for 2nd-degree connections for easier outreach.
3.  **Strict Filtering**:
    - EXCLUDE any founder already in the IT, Software, or Digital Marketing space.
    - EXCLUDE founders whose profiles indicate they already have a strong internal tech team.
4.  **Deep Research**:
    - Visit each candidate's LinkedIn profile.
    - Find their company website URL.
    - Visit the company website using `web_fetch` or `browser`.
5.  **Gap Analysis**:
    - Analyze the website for: Speed, Mobile Responsiveness, SEO, E-commerce capabilities, and overall modern aesthetic.
    - Identify specific needs (e.g., "No mobile app", "Outdated UI", "No CRM/ERP integration").
6.  **Reporting**:
    - Compile a list of 10 qualified prospects.
    - Include: Name, LinkedIn URL, Company, Website Status, Specific Needs, and a "Pitch Idea".
    - Generate a professional HTML-based PDF report.

## Tools to Use

- **browser**: For LinkedIn search and profile viewing.
- **web_fetch**: For quick website analysis.
- **write**: To create the HTML template for the PDF.

## PDF Template (HTML Structure)

Use the following CSS principles for a premium feel:

- LinkedIn Blue (`#0077b5`) for headers.
- Clean, modern typography (sans-serif).
- Priority badges (High/Medium/Low).
- Structured grids for easy scanning.

## Outreach Principles

- **Personalized**: Reference something specific from their profile or website.
- **Problem-First**: Focus on the gap identified (e.g., "Your brand is growing on social, but your website is broken").
- **Local Advantage**: If in the same city (Surat), emphasize face-to-face consultation.
