# Find My

Control the native Find My app via Peekaboo. No sketchy APIs or credential sharing.

**Run scripts from:** `cd {skillDir}`

## Requirements

| Requirement     | Details                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**          | macOS only                                                          |
| **Apps**        | Find My.app (must be open), OpenClaw.app (provides Peekaboo bridge) |
| **Permissions** | OpenClaw.app needs Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions     |
| **Peekaboo**    | CLI must be installed and configured                                |

## Privacy & Security

**What this skill accesses:**

- Location data for people, devices, and items in your Find My app
- Screenshots of the Find My window (stored locally in `/tmp/`)

**What this skill does NOT do:**

- No network requests to third-party services
- No credential storage or Apple ID access
- No data exfiltration — all operations are local UI automation

**Data scope:** The skill can see/interact with anything visible in your Find My app, including:

- Shared locations of family/friends
- Device locations (yours and Family Sharing members)
- AirTag/item locations

**User awareness:** This skill uses mouse clicks and UI automation. You will see the actions happening on screen.

## Known Limitations

1. **`--app "Find My"` hangs** in Peekaboo - use `--window-id` instead
2. **Sidebar items not accessible** - Find My doesn't expose item names via accessibility APIs
3. **Position-based selection** - Select items by position (1st, 2nd, 3rd...) not by name
4. **macOS only** - Requires Peekaboo + OpenClaw.app bridge
5. **Exclusive control** - User cannot interact with the Mac while skill is running (mouse/clicks conflict)

## Quick Reference

| Script                          | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `fm-window.sh`                  | Get window ID and bounds (JSON)          |
| `fm-screenshot.sh [path]`       | Capture Find My window                   |
| `fm-tab.sh <tab>`               | Switch tab: `people`, `devices`, `items` |
| `fm-list.sh [tab]`              | Screenshot + show sidebar positions      |
| `fm-select-item.sh <pos> [tab]` | Select item by position (1, 2, 3...)     |
| `fm-locate.sh <pos> [tab]`      | Select item and screenshot location      |
| `fm-info.sh [path]`             | Open info panel, screenshot              |
| `fm-play-sound.sh <pos>`        | Attempt to play sound on item            |
| `fm-click.sh <x> <y>`           | Click at relative window coords          |

## Workflow Examples

### List available items

```bash
./scripts/fm-list.sh items
# Screenshots the Items tab - view image to see your AirTags/items
```

### Find your keys (if keys are 2nd item in list)

```bash
./scripts/fm-locate.sh 2 items
# Shows location on map, outputs screenshot path
```

### Play sound on keys

```bash
./scripts/fm-play-sound.sh 2
# Selects 2nd item, attempts to click Play Sound
# May require manual click if button not found
```

### Check on a family member

```bash
./scripts/fm-list.sh people
# View screenshot to see who's listed

./scripts/fm-locate.sh 1 people
# Shows first person's location
```

## UI Layout Reference

### Tab Bar (y ≈ 68 from window top)

| Tab     | X Position |
| ------- | ---------- |
| People  | ~63        |
| Devices | ~154       |
| Items   | ~243       |

### Sidebar Items (x ≈ 150)

| Position  | Y Coordinate |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1st item  | ~120         |
| 2nd item  | ~174         |
| 3rd item  | ~228         |
| 4th item  | ~282         |
| (spacing) | +54px each   |

## Manual Coordinate Clicks

When automation fails, calculate coordinates manually:

```bash
# Get window position
./scripts/fm-window.sh
# Output: {"x": 824, "y": 62, "width": 1024, "height": 768, "window_id": 2248}

# Click at relative position within window
./scripts/fm-click.sh 150 174   # 2nd sidebar item
./scripts/fm-click.sh 243 68    # Items tab
```

## Info Panel Actions

After selecting an item, click the ⓘ button on the map popup to open the info panel:

| Action            | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Play Sound**    | Make AirTag chirp (items only) |
| **Directions**    | Open Maps with directions      |
| **Share**         | Share location with others     |
| **Lost Mode**     | Enable contact info sharing    |
| **Notifications** | Configure alerts               |

## Troubleshooting

**"Find My window not found"**

- Ensure Find My.app is open
- Check OpenClaw.app is running (provides Peekaboo bridge)

**Clicks not registering**

- Window may have moved - re-run `fm-window.sh` for fresh coordinates
- Ensure Find My is frontmost before clicking

**Can't find Play Sound button**

- Open info panel manually (click ⓘ on map popup)
- Then re-run play-sound script

## Future Improvements

When Peekaboo fixes `--app "Find My"`:

- Direct element targeting without coordinate calculation
- Reliable accessibility tree for sidebar items
- Simpler automation flows
