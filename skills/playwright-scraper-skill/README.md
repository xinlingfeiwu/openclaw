## 📖 Two Modes

| Mode           | Use Case              | Speed          | Anti-Bot    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Simple**     | Regular dynamic sites | Fast (3-5s)    | None        |
| **Stealth** ⭐ | Sites with anti-bot   | Medium (5-20s) | Medium-High |

### Simple Mode

For sites without anti-bot protection:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-simple.js <URL>
```

### Stealth Mode (Recommended)

For sites with Cloudflare or anti-bot protection:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

**Anti-Bot Techniques:**

- Hide `navigator.webdriver`
- Realistic User-Agent (iPhone)
- Human-like behavior simulation
- Screenshot and HTML saving support

## 🎯 Customization

All scripts support environment variables:

```bash
# Show browser
HEADLESS=false node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>

# Custom wait time (milliseconds)
WAIT_TIME=10000 node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>

# Save screenshot
SCREENSHOT_PATH=/tmp/page.png node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>

# Save HTML

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Try web_fetch first** — OpenClaw's built-in tool is fastest
2. **Use Simple for dynamic sites** — When no anti-bot protection
3. **Use Stealth for protected sites** ⭐ — Main workhorse
4. **Use specialized skills** — For YouTube, Reddit, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Getting 403 blocked?

Use Stealth mode:

```bash
node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

### Cloudflare challenge?

Increase wait time + headful mode:

```bash
HEADLESS=false WAIT_TIME=30000 node scripts/playwright-stealth.js <URL>
```

### Playwright not found?

Reinstall:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```
