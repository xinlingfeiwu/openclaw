# SaaS: Subscriptions That Scale

## Freemium vs Trial

No universal rule. Consider:

| Factor            | → Freemium | → Trial      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Network effects   | Strong     | Weak         |
| Time to value     | <5 min     | >30 min      |
| Viral coefficient | >0.5       | <0.3         |
| Sales cycle       | Self-serve | Touch needed |

**The real question:** Do free users CREATE value for paid users?

- Yes → Freemium (Slack, Figma)
- No → Trial (Superhuman, Linear)

## Tier Structure

Three tiers. Make the middle one a decoy.

|                    | Starter | Pro          | Team            |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Price              | $29/mo  | $79/mo       | $99/mo          |
| Core features      | ✓       | ✓            | ✓               |
| Limits             | Low     | High         | Unlimited       |
| Key differentiator | —       | Main feature | + Team features |

Pro at $79 makes Team at $99 obvious value.

**Per-seat?** Only if value scales with people. If not, usage-based or flat.

## Value Metric Selection

**Test:** If customer doubles the metric, do they pay 2x AND feel good about it?

| Metric         | Works For                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Per seat       | Collaboration (Slack, Notion)   |
| Per usage      | APIs, infrastructure (Twilio)   |
| Per feature    | Horizontal (Zapier)             |
| Flat + overage | Predictable + growth (Intercom) |

## Annual vs Monthly

- Discount: 15-20% (more devalues)
- Frame as savings: "$79/year (save $79)" not "17% off"
- Default UI to annual
- Target: 60% annual, 40% monthly

## Enterprise Readiness

**Don't build enterprise features until enterprises ask.**

When they do, minimum requirements:

| Feature           | Why                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| SSO (SAML)        | Security compliance    |
| SCIM              | Auto user provisioning |
| Audit logs        | Who did what, when     |
| Role-based access | Admin/Member/Viewer    |

**If they ask for SSO, price floor is $1,000/month.** They can pay it.

## Expansion Revenue

Target: Net Revenue Retention >110%

| Tactic         | When to Trigger       |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Seat expansion | Team invites increase |
| Usage upsell   | 80% of limit          |
| Tier upgrade   | Request Pro feature   |

**Automate:** Emails at 70%, 90%, 100% of limits.

## Churn Prevention

**Warning signs:**

- Login <1x/week
- Core features unused
- Support tickets spike then silence

**Actions:**

- Health score alerts to CS
- Offer "pause" instead of cancel
- Exit survey with retention offer (meaningful, not desperate)

## Quick NRR Formula

```
NRR = (Start MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) ÷ Start MRR

Target: >110%
Great: >120%
```

## What to Avoid

- Pricing tables copied from competitors without understanding why
- "Contact us" as the only enterprise option (lazy)
- Free tier that's 90% of the product (no urgency)
- Discounting to close every deal (trains customers)
- Grandfathering everyone forever (pricing debt)
