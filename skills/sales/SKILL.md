## Outreach Automation

### Cold Outreach Sequence

**Day 1: Initial Email**

```
Subject: [Personalized hook based on research]

Hi [Name],

[Observation about their company/role — show you did research].

[One sentence about what you do and why it's relevant to them].

[Specific question or soft CTA].

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Day 3: Follow-up 1**

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried — [brief restate of value].

[New angle or additional value point].

Worth a quick chat?

[Your name]
```

```

Hi [Name],

Found this [article/resource/insight] and thought of you: [link]

[Brief explanation of why it's relevant].

[Your name]
```

**Day 14: Break-up Email**

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming the timing isn't right.

No worries — I'll close out my notes for now.

If things change, feel free to reply anytime.

[Your name]
```

---

## CRM Integration

### Built-in Tracking

If you don't use an external CRM, use markdown files:

```
sales/
├── leads/
│   ├── company-name.md
│   └── ...
├── pipeline.md
├── analytics/
│   ├── weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md
│   └── ...
└── templates/
```

### External CRM Integration

**HubSpot:** Use HubSpot API for syncing
**Salesforce:** Use Salesforce API for syncing
**Notion:** Export/import via CSV or API

---

## Best Practices

1. **Follow up relentlessly** — 80% of sales need 5+ touchpoints
2. **Personalize everything** — Generic outreach = ignore
3. **Always have next step** — Every conversation ends with clear action
4. **Track why you lose** — More valuable than why you win
5. **Speed to lead** — Respond within 5 minutes when possible
6. **Listen more than talk** — Discovery > Pitching
7. **Document everything** — Your future self will thank you
8. **Review pipeline weekly** — Stale deals kill forecasts

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Pitching before understanding** — Do discovery first
❌ **Forgetting to follow up** — Use reminders religiously
❌ **Vanity metrics** — Calls made matters less than meetings held
❌ **Ignoring closed-lost** — They can become wins later
❌ **No CRM hygiene** — Bad data = bad decisions
