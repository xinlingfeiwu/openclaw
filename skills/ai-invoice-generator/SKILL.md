## Output Formats

### Markdown (default)

Clean markdown table format, easy to paste into emails or docs.

### HTML

Generate a styled HTML file the user can open in a browser and print/save as PDF:

- Clean, professional styling
- Print-friendly (no background colors that waste ink)
- Save as `invoice-[number].html`

## Rules

- Always calculate totals correctly. Double-check math.
- Invoice numbers should be sequential. Check for existing invoices if possible.
- Due date = invoice date + payment terms (Net 30 = 30 days, etc.)
- Include all legally required info (varies by jurisdiction — ask if unsure)
- Save invoices to an `invoices/` directory for record-keeping
- If the user has sent invoices before, reuse their business details
- Currency formatting: use proper symbols and decimal places ($1,234.56)

## Recurring Invoices

If the user bills the same client regularly:

- "Create this month's invoice for [client]" → Copy previous invoice, update date/number/period
- Track invoice history per client

## Quick Commands

- "Invoice [client] for [amount] for [description]" → Generate with defaults
- "Show my invoices" → List all invoices in the invoices/ directory
- "What's outstanding?" → Show unpaid invoices past due date
