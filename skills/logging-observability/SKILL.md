# Logging & Observability

Patterns for building observable systems across the three pillars: logs, metrics, and traces.

## Three Pillars

| Pillar      | Purpose             | Question It Answers        | Example                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logs**    | What happened       | Why did this request fail? | `{"level":"error","msg":"payment declined","user_id":"u_82"}` |
| **Metrics** | How much / how fast | Is latency increasing?     | `http_request_duration_seconds{route="/api/orders"} 0.342`    |
| **Traces**  | Request flow        | Where is the bottleneck?   | Span: `api-gateway → auth → order-service → db`               |

Each pillar is strongest when correlated. Embed `trace_id` in every log line to jump from a log entry to the full distributed trace.

---

## Structured Logging

Always emit logs as structured JSON — never free-text strings.

### Required Fields

| Field            | Purpose                               | Required        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `timestamp`      | ISO-8601 with milliseconds            | Yes             |
| `level`          | Severity (DEBUG … FATAL)              | Yes             |
| `service`        | Originating service name              | Yes             |
| `message`        | Human-readable description            | Yes             |
| `trace_id`       | Distributed trace correlation         | Yes             |
| `span_id`        | Current span within trace             | Yes             |
| `correlation_id` | Business-level correlation (order ID) | When applicable |
| `error`          | Structured error object               | On errors       |
| `context`        | Request-specific metadata             | Recommended     |

### Context Enrichment

Attach context at the middleware level so downstream logs inherit automatically:

```typescript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const ctx = {
    trace_id: req.headers["x-trace-id"] || crypto.randomUUID(),
    request_id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    user_id: req.user?.id,
    method: req.method,
    path: req.path,
  };
  asyncLocalStorage.run(ctx, () => next());
});
```

### Library Recommendations

| Library       | Language | Strengths                              | Perf      |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Pino**      | Node.js  | Fastest Node logger, low overhead      | Excellent |
| **structlog** | Python   | Composable processors, context binding | Good      |
| **zerolog**   | Go       | Zero-allocation JSON logging           | Excellent |
| **zap**       | Go       | High performance, typed fields         | Excellent |
| **tracing**   | Rust     | Spans + events, async-aware            | Excellent |

Choose a logger that outputs structured JSON natively. Avoid loggers requiring post-processing.

## Log Levels

| Level     | When to Use                            | Example                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **FATAL** | App cannot continue, process will exit | Database connection pool exhausted     |
| **ERROR** | Operation failed, needs attention      | Payment charge failed: CARD_DECLINED   |
| **WARN**  | Unexpected but recoverable             | Retry 2/3 for upstream timeout         |
| **INFO**  | Normal business events                 | Order ORD-1234 placed successfully     |
| **DEBUG** | Developer troubleshooting              | Cache miss for key user:82:preferences |
| **TRACE** | Very fine-grained (rarely in prod)     | Entering validateAddress with payload  |

**Rules:** Production default = INFO and above. If you log an ERROR, someone should act on it. Every FATAL should trigger an alert.

---

## Distributed Tracing

### OpenTelemetry Setup

Always prefer OpenTelemetry over vendor-specific SDKs:

```typescript
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: "order-service",
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces",
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});
sdk.start();
```

### Span Creation

```typescript
const tracer = trace.getTracer("order-service");

async function processOrder(order: Order) {
  return tracer.startActiveSpan("processOrder", async (span) => {
    try {
      span.setAttribute("order.id", order.id);
      span.setAttribute("order.total_cents", order.totalCents);
      await validateInventory(order);
      await chargePayment(order);
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
    } catch (err) {
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: err.message });
      span.recordException(err);
      throw err;
    } finally {
      span.end();
    }
  });
}
```

### Context Propagation

- Use W3C Trace Context (`traceparent` header) — default in OTel
- Propagate across HTTP, gRPC, and message queues
- For async workers: serialise `traceparent` into the job payload

### Trace Sampling

| Strategy                 | Use When                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Always On**            | Low-traffic services, debugging |
| **Probabilistic** (N%)   | General production use          |
| **Rate-limited** (N/sec) | High-throughput services        |
| **Tail-based**           | When you need all error traces  |

Always sample 100% of error traces regardless of strategy.

---

## Metrics Collection

### RED Method (Request-Driven)

Monitor these three for every service endpoint:

| Metric       | What It Measures     | Prometheus Example                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rate**     | Requests/sec         | `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`                           |
| **Errors**   | Failed request ratio | `rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])`            |
| **Duration** | Response time        | `histogram_quantile(0.99, http_request_duration_seconds)` |

### USE Method (Resource-Driven)

For infrastructure components (CPU, memory, disk, network):

| Metric          | What It Measures         | Example                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Utilization** | % resource busy          | CPU usage at 78%                  |
| **Saturation**  | Work queued/waiting      | 12 requests queued in thread pool |
| **Errors**      | Error events on resource | 3 disk I/O errors in last minute  |

---

## Monitoring Stack

| Tool              | Category      | Best For                             |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Prometheus**    | Metrics       | Pull-based metrics, alerting rules   |
| **Grafana**       | Visualisation | Dashboards for metrics, logs, traces |
| **Jaeger**        | Tracing       | Distributed trace visualisation      |
| **Loki**          | Logs          | Log aggregation (pairs with Grafana) |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Collection    | Vendor-neutral telemetry collection  |

**Recommendation:** Start with OTel Collector → Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Jaeger. Migrate to SaaS only when operational overhead justifies cost.

---

## Alert Design

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time  | Example                             |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **P1**   | Immediate      | Service fully down, data loss       |
| **P2**   | < 30 min       | Error rate > 5%, latency p99 > 5s   |
| **P3**   | Business hours | Disk > 80%, cert expiring in 7 days |
| **P4**   | Best effort    | Non-critical deprecation warning    |

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

- **Alert on symptoms, not causes** — "error rate > 5%" not "pod restarted"
- **Multi-window, multi-burn-rate** — catch both sudden spikes and slow burns
- **Require runbook links** — every alert must link to diagnosis and remediation
- **Review monthly** — delete or tune alerts that never fire or always fire
- **Group related alerts** — use inhibition rules to suppress child alerts
- **Set appropriate thresholds** — if alert fires daily and is ignored, raise threshold or delete

---

## Dashboard Patterns

### Overview Dashboard ("War Room")

- Total requests/sec across all services
- Global error rate (%) with trendline
- p50 / p95 / p99 latency
- Active alerts count by severity
- Deployment markers overlaid on graphs

### Service Dashboard (Per-Service)

- RED metrics for each endpoint
- Dependency health (upstream/downstream success rates)
- Resource utilisation (CPU, memory, connections)
- Top errors table with count and last seen

---

## Observability Checklist

Every service must have:

- [ ] Structured JSON logging with consistent schema
- [ ] Correlation / trace IDs propagated on all requests
- [ ] RED metrics exposed for every external endpoint
- [ ] Health check endpoints (`/healthz` and `/readyz`)
- [ ] Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Dashboards for RED metrics and resource utilisation
- [ ] Alerts for error rate, latency, and saturation with runbook links
- [ ] Log level configurable at runtime without redeployment
- [ ] PII scrubbing verified and tested
- [ ] Retention policies defined for logs, metrics, and traces

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                  | Problem                                  | Fix                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Logging PII                   | Privacy/compliance violation             | Mask or exclude PII; use token references  |
| Excessive logging             | Storage costs balloon, signal drowns     | Log business events, not data flow         |
| Unstructured logs             | Cannot query or alert on fields          | Use structured JSON with consistent schema |
| String interpolation          | Breaks structured fields, injection risk | Pass fields as metadata, not in message    |
| Missing correlation IDs       | Cannot trace across services             | Generate and propagate trace_id everywhere |
| Alert storms                  | On-call fatigue, real issues buried      | Use grouping, inhibition, deduplication    |
| Metrics with high cardinality | Prometheus OOM, dashboard timeouts       | Never use user ID or request ID as label   |

## NEVER Do

1. **NEVER log passwords, tokens, API keys, or secrets** — even at DEBUG level
2. **NEVER use console.log / print in production** — use a structured logger
3. **NEVER use user IDs, emails, or request IDs as metric labels** — cardinality will explode
4. **NEVER create alerts without a runbook link** — unactionable alerts erode trust
5. **NEVER rely on logs alone** — you need metrics and traces for full observability
6. **NEVER log request/response bodies by default** — opt-in only, with PII redaction
7. **NEVER ignore log volume** — set budgets and alert when a service exceeds daily quota
8. **NEVER skip context propagation in async flows** — broken traces are worse than no traces
