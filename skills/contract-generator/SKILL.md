## Important Notes

1. These are TEMPLATES — always customize for the specific engagement
2. Include specific deliverables — vague scope is the #1 source of disputes
3. Always include an "Out of Scope" section — prevents scope creep
4. Payment milestones tied to deliverables protect both parties
5. The IP clause should match the engagement — some clients need work-for-hire language
6. Recommend both parties sign digitally (DocuSign, HelloSign) for convenience and records
