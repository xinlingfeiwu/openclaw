# Commitment Tracking

## What Gets Tracked

Every promise or commitment made in conversation:

**Trigger phrases:**

- "I'll send you..."
- "Let me get back to you..."
- "I'll check on that..."
- "I promised to..."
- "Can you remind me to..."
- "I need to tell X about Y"

**Extracted data:**
| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| What | Send proposal |
| To whom | Client X |
| By when | Friday 5pm |
| Context | Follow-up to meeting |

## Storage Format

In `~/planner/commitments`:

```markdown

## Reminder System

**Automatic reminders:**

| Time before deadline | Action                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 week               | Include in weekly planning               |
| 48 hours             | Add to daily briefing                    |
| 24 hours             | Explicit reminder: "Tomorrow: X due"     |
| 2 hours              | Final alert: "X due in 2h, is it ready?" |
| Overdue              | Flag daily until resolved                |

**Overdue handling:**
Don't nag constantly. Daily morning briefing includes:
"Overdue: 2 items. [Show them]. Update status or mark done?"

---

## Follow-up Tracking

For things waiting on others:

**Trigger phrases:**

- "I'm waiting for X to..."
- "Ball's in their court"
- "They said they'd get back to me"
- "Sent, waiting for response"

**Follow-up rules:**

- After 72h with no response: "Want me to draft a follow-up?"
- After 1 week: "X hasn't replied. Priority: high/low?"
- Passive mode: just track, don't prompt (for low-priority)

**Storage in commitments file:**

```markdown
### Waiting On Others

- [ ] **Response from Client Y on proposal** — Sent: Mon
  - Follow-up if no reply by: Thu
  - Status: ⏳ waiting
```

## Commitment Patterns

Track over time to identify issues:

**Metrics to monitor:**

- How many commitments made per week
- What % completed on time
- What topics keep getting pushed (pattern)
- Who you make most commitments to

**Weekly insight:**
"You made 12 commitments last week, completed 8. The 4 pushed were all admin tasks. Consider batching admin or delegating."

**Overcommitment alert:**
If open commitments > historical average + 50%:
"You have 15 open commitments. Your average is 10. This week might be unrealistic."

- Commitments due today (must complete)

- Overdue items (need attention)

**Evening review includes:**

- New commitments made today (confirm logged)
