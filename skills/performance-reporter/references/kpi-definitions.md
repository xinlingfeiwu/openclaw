## 1. Organic Search KPIs

### Organic Sessions

| Attribute        | Detail                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | Number of visits to your site originating from organic (unpaid) search engine results |
| **Formula**      | Count of sessions where medium = "organic"                                            |
| **Data Source**  | ~~analytics (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or equivalent)                        |
| **Good Range**   | Growing month-over-month; 3-10% MoM growth is healthy                                 |
| **Warning**      | Decline >10% MoM without known seasonal cause                                         |
| **Segmentation** | Always separate brand vs. non-brand organic sessions                                  |

**Interpretation:**

- Growing organic sessions with stable conversion rate = SEO strategy is working.
- Growing sessions but declining conversions = traffic quality issue; check keyword targeting.
- Flat sessions despite new content = content not ranking or cannibalizing existing pages.

### Organic Click-Through Rate (CTR)

| Attribute        | Detail                                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Good Range**   | >3% overall; varies significantly by position and query type         |
| **Warning**      | <1.5% overall or declining trend                                     |
| **Segmentation** | By query type (brand vs. non-brand), by page, by position range      |

**Benchmarks by Position:**

| Position | Expected CTR Range |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| #1       | 25-35%             |
| #2       | 12-18%             |
| #3       | 8-13%              |
| #4-5     | 4-8%               |
| #6-10    | 2-5%               |
| #11-20   | 0.5-2%             |

**Interpretation:**

- High impressions but low CTR = title tags and meta descriptions need optimization.
- CTR declining for stable positions = SERP features (AI Overview, PAA) stealing clicks.
- CTR higher than position benchmarks = strong brand recognition or compelling snippets.

### Average Position

| Attribute        | Detail                                                       |

| **Good Range**   | <20 for tracked keywords; improving trend                    |
| **Warning**      | >30 or rising (worsening) trend                              |
| **Segmentation** | By keyword group, by page, by intent type                    |

**Interpretation:**

- Average position is a directional indicator, not an absolute measure. A few very low-ranking keywords can drag the average down significantly.
- Always pair with keyword distribution (how many keywords in top 10, top 20, etc.) for a complete picture.

### Keyword Visibility Score

| Attribute        | Detail                                                                            |

| **Good Range**   | Growing over time; absolute value depends on niche                                |
| **Warning**      | Declining trend for 3+ consecutive weeks                                          |
| **Segmentation** | By topic cluster, by competitor                                                   |

**Interpretation:**

- Visibility score accounts for both ranking position and keyword importance (volume).
- A single high-volume keyword moving from #1 to #5 can cause a larger visibility drop than 20 low-volume keywords dropping off page 1.

| **Good Range**   | Indexed count close to total intended indexable pages; growing with new content             |
| **Warning**      | Indexed count dropping without intentional removal; large gap between submitted and indexed |
| **Segmentation** | By sitemap, by content type, by subdirectory                                                |

**Interpretation:**

- Indexed < submitted = quality or technical issues preventing indexing.
- Sudden drop in indexed pages = possible noindex tag, robots.txt change, or manual action.
- Indexed > intended = duplicate content, parameter URLs, or faceted navigation issues.

**Industry Benchmarks:**

| Industry           | Typical Organic CVR   |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| SaaS / Software    | 2-5%                  |
