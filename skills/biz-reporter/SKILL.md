# Biz Reporter

Business intelligence that writes itself. Pull data from multiple sources, spot trends, and generate beautiful reports — on demand or on schedule.

## Why This Exists

Data & Analytics has only 18 skills out of 3,286 on ClawHub — the most underserved category by far. Yet automated reporting is called "the most universally loved automation" in the OpenClaw community. Every business needs it, nobody has built it properly.

## How It Works

Biz Reporter connects to the user's business tools, pulls key metrics, applies trend analysis, and generates a formatted report. It works with whatever tools the user has — from a solo founder with just Google Analytics to a team with a full data stack.

## Supported Data Sources

### Web Analytics

- **Google Analytics (GA4)**: sessions, users, pageviews, bounce rate, top pages, traffic sources
- **Google Search Console**: impressions, clicks, CTR, average position, top queries
- Access via `gog` tool, browser automation, or API calls

### Revenue & Payments

- **Stripe**: MRR, revenue, new customers, churn, top products
- **PayPal**: transaction summaries
- Access via CLI tools or API calls with stored credentials

### Social Media

- **Twitter/X**: followers, engagement, top posts
- **LinkedIn**: page views, post engagement, follower growth
- **Instagram**: reach, engagement, follower count
- Access via APIs or browser automation

### CRM & Sales

- **HubSpot**: leads, pipeline value, deals closed, contact growth
- **Airtable**: custom database metrics
- Access via API with stored keys

### Custom Sources

- **Any API**: the user can specify custom API endpoints to pull data from
- **CSV files**: if the user dumps data as CSV, parse and include it
- **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets via API

### Monthly Business Review

Deep analysis with historical comparisons and strategic recommendations.

Follow the weekly format but expand with:

- Month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons
- Cohort analysis for customer retention (if data available)
- Content performance breakdown (which articles drove traffic)
- Funnel analysis: visitors → signups → customers (if trackable)
- Strategic recommendations section with specific actions

### Custom Report

If the user asks for something specific, build it:

- "Show me our top 10 pages by revenue contribution"
- "Compare this month's social engagement to last month"
- "What keywords are we losing rankings for?"

## Trend Detection

Biz Reporter doesn't just show numbers — it spots patterns:

1. **Week-over-week anomalies**: flag metrics that changed more than 20% from the prior week
2. **Declining trends**: if a metric has dropped for 3+ consecutive periods, raise it prominently
3. **Correlation hints**: "Traffic from Twitter spiked 40% — this correlates with your viral post on [date]"
4. **Seasonal patterns**: if historical data shows patterns (e.g., weekend dips), note them instead of alerting
5. **Comparison framing**: always show the comparison baseline so numbers have context

## Natural Language Queries

Users can ask questions about their data conversationally:

| User says                                        | Action                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "How's our traffic this week?"                   | Quick web analytics summary with week-over-week comparison |
| "What's our MRR?"                                | Pull Stripe data, show current MRR with trend              |
| "Which blog posts are getting the most traffic?" | Top pages report from GA4                                  |
| "Are we ranking better or worse this month?"     | Search Console comparison                                  |
| "Generate my weekly report"                      | Full weekly marketing report                               |
| "How did our launch go?"                         | Pull metrics for a specific date range around the launch   |
| "Show me revenue by month for the last 6 months" | Historical revenue chart description                       |

## Scheduling Reports

Help users set up recurring reports via cron:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Daily KPI snapshot",
    "schedule": "0 8 * * 1-5",
    "prompt": "Generate daily KPI snapshot and send to Slack #metrics"
  },
  {
    "name": "Weekly marketing report",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * 1",
    "prompt": "Generate weekly marketing report for last week and send via email"
  },
  {
    "name": "Monthly business review",
    "schedule": "0 10 1 * *",
    "prompt": "Generate monthly business review for last month and post to Notion"
  }
]
```

## Setup & Configuration

On first use:

1. **Discover available tools**: check which data sources the user has access to (GA4, Stripe, etc.)
2. **Authenticate**: help configure API keys or tool access for each source. Store securely in environment variables, never in SKILL.md or memory.
3. **Baseline**: pull initial data to establish benchmarks for future comparisons
4. **Preferences**: ask about reporting frequency, delivery channel, and which metrics matter most
5. **Store config**: save all preferences in workspace memory

## Output Formats

Reports can be delivered as:

- **Chat message**: formatted directly in the conversation or messaging channel
- **Markdown file**: saved to workspace for archival
- **Notion page**: if Notion skill is available
- **Email**: via configured email skill
- **Slack/Discord message**: for team channels

## Edge Cases

- **Partial data**: if some sources are unavailable, generate the report with what's available and note what's missing
- **No historical data**: on first run, can only show current snapshot. Note that comparisons will be available next period.
- **API rate limits**: cache data within a session and batch requests
- **Zero traffic / new site**: don't show depressing "0 visitors" — instead focus on setup progress and first wins
- **Multiple properties**: if user has multiple websites/products, ask which one or generate combined report
- **Currency**: detect user locale and format currency appropriately
- **Privacy**: never include individual user data or PII in reports. Aggregate only.
