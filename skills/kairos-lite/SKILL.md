# Kairos Lite

Use this skill when you want proactive behavior, but not a full always-on autonomous platform.

## Use It For

- scheduled repo patrols
- unattended follow-up checks
- short user-facing briefs after background work
- proactive jobs with expiry

## Avoid It For

- unrestricted permanent daemons
- hidden background mutation without explicit user opt-in
- complex host-specific notification plumbing as an MVP

## Quick Start

Create a portable proactive job spec:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/job_spec.py \
  --name "daily-repo-check" \
  --prompt "Summarize risky changes in the repo" \
  --schedule "0 9 * * 1-5"
```

Then use the prompt in [references/prompt-template.md](./references/prompt-template.md).

## Minimum Building Blocks

- sleep or wait
- a schedule or automation trigger
- a brief output channel
- expiry or renewal

## OpenClaw Notes

For this workspace, prefer explicit, bounded proactive jobs and manage recurring jobs through `openclaw cron add`, not by editing config JSON directly.

OpenClaw-oriented helper:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/openclaw_job_spec.py --name "daily-repo-check" --prompt "Summarize risky changes" --schedule "0 9 * * 1-5"
```
