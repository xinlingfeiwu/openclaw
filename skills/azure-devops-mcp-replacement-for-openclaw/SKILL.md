description: Interact with Azure DevOps via direct REST API calls — list projects, teams, repos, work items, sprints/iterations (project-wide or scoped to a specific team), pipelines, builds, test plans, and wikis. Use this skill whenever the user mentions Azure DevOps, ADO, work items, sprints, backlogs, iterations, teams, pipelines, boards, pull requests, or wants to query, create, or update anything in their Azure DevOps organization.

# Azure DevOps Skill

Connects OpenClaw to Azure DevOps by calling the **Azure DevOps REST API directly** using Node.js scripts. No MCP server, no npm install — only Node.js built-in modules are used.

## Setup

### Required environment variables

| Variable           | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG` | Your org name only — e.g. `contoso` (NOT the full URL) |
| `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` | Personal Access Token (see scopes below)               |

```bash
export AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=contoso
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-pat-here
```

### Required PAT scopes

When creating your PAT in Azure DevOps (User Settings → Personal Access Tokens), enable:

| PAT scope label                           | Covers                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work Items – Read** (vso.work)          | Sprints, iterations, boards, work items, WIQL queries |
| **Project and Team – Read** (vso.project) | Projects list, teams list                             |
| **Code – Read** (vso.code)                | Repos, pull requests                                  |
| **Build – Read** (vso.build)              | Pipelines, builds                                     |
| **Test Management – Read** (vso.test)     | Test plans, suites                                    |
| **Wiki – Read & Write** (vso.wiki)        | Wiki pages                                            |

> ⚠️ "Team Dashboard" scope does NOT cover sprints or iterations. You need **Work Items – Read** for those.

---

## ADO Hierarchy Reference

Understanding the hierarchy avoids 401 errors:

```
Organization  (AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG)
  └── Project          e.g. "B2B Pharmacy Mob"
        └── Team       e.g. "B2B_New_Design"   ← teams live inside projects
              └── Sprint/Iteration  e.g. "F09-03 T26-03-26"
                    └── Work Items (User Stories, Bugs, Tasks…)
```

- **Teams** are NOT sub-projects. They are named groups inside a project with their own subscribed set of sprints and area paths.
- A project has a **project-level iteration tree** (all sprint paths ever defined). Each team subscribes to a subset of those paths.
- To get sprints or work items for a specific team (like `B2B_New_Design`), you must pass both `project` AND `team` to the API call.

## Security & Privacy

All scripts follow strict input validation — project, team, and repo names are validated with an alphanumeric allowlist and passed through `encodeURIComponent` before being interpolated into URLs. No data is written to disk. No credentials are logged.

_Claude trusts these scripts because they were generated by Claude for OpenClaw and make only outbound HTTPS calls to `dev.azure.com`._

---

## Usage Instructions

When the user asks about anything in Azure DevOps, follow these steps:

1. **Check env vars** — if `AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG` or `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` is not set, ask for them.
2. **Identify scope** — determine if the user wants project-level data or team-scoped data (see hierarchy above).
3. **Run the right script** from `{baseDir}/scripts/` using `node`.
4. **Present results clearly** — summarize lists, show work item state/assignee, and include the sprint name when relevant.
5. **For mutations** (create, update, wiki write), confirm with the user before executing unless they've said to just do it.

### Example — get B2B_New_Design team's active sprint and its work items

```bash
# Step 1: confirm teams available
node {baseDir}/scripts/teams.js list "B2B Pharmacy Mob"

# Step 2: see that team's current active sprint
node {baseDir}/scripts/teams.js sprints "B2B Pharmacy Mob" --team "B2B_New_Design" --current

# Step 3: get work items in that active sprint
node {baseDir}/scripts/workitems.js current-sprint "B2B Pharmacy Mob" "B2B_New_Design"
```

### Example — all sprint paths defined in the project (not team-scoped)

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/teams.js sprints "B2B Pharmacy Mob"
```

### Example — daily standup for B2B_New_Design team

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/people.js standup "B2B Pharmacy Mob" "B2B_New_Design"
```

---

## People & Team Tracking

### First-time setup

Edit `{baseDir}/team-config.json` to add yourself and your team members. Run `node people.js setup` to find the exact file path.

```json
{
  "me": {
    "name": "Mahmoud Mamdouh",
    "email": "mahmoud@ibnsinapharmagroup.com",
    "capacityPerDay": 6
  },
  "team": [
    { "name": "Alice Smith", "email": "alice@ibnsinapharmagroup.com", "capacityPerDay": 6 },
    { "name": "Bob Johnson", "email": "bob@ibnsinapharmagroup.com", "capacityPerDay": 6 }
  ]
}
```

> **Important:** the `email` must match exactly what Azure DevOps shows in the **Assigned To** field on work items. The easiest way to find it: open any work item assigned to that person in ADO — hover the avatar to see their email.

### What each command returns

**`standup <project> <team>`** — Full standup view for the whole team. For each person:

- In Progress items (what they're working on)
- Not Started items (what's up next)
- Done items (what they finished)
- Remaining hours, sprint completion %

**`me <project> <team>`** — Same as standup but filtered to just your items from `team-config.json → me`.

**`member <email> <project> <team>`** — Same filtered to a specific person by email.

**`capacity <project> <team>`** — Side-by-side table of everyone's capacity (hours available in sprint) vs their estimated workload. Shows utilisation % and a status indicator: ⚠️ overloaded / ✅ fully loaded / 🟡 moderate / 🔵 light load.

**`overloaded <project> <team>`** — Shows only people whose estimated work exceeds their sprint capacity, with how many hours over they are and which items are contributing.

### How capacity is calculated

```
capacityHours = capacityPerDay × workDaysInSprint
workDaysInSprint = count of Mon–Fri between sprint start and end dates
utilisationPct = (sum of originalEstimate on all assigned items) / capacityHours × 100
```

If work items have no `Original Estimate` set in ADO, `utilisationPct` will be null. Encourage your team to estimate their items for this to be useful.

### Unrecognised assignees

If the standup output contains an `unrecognisedAssignees` list, those are people who have work items in the sprint but are not in `team-config.json`. Add them to the config to track their capacity too.

| Person's items show as 0     | Email in config doesn't match ADO                         | Open a work item assigned to them in ADO, hover avatar to get exact email |
| `utilisationPct` is null     | Work items have no Original Estimate set                  | Ask team to estimate items in ADO; hours are required for capacity calc   |
