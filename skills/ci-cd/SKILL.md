## When to Use

Trigger on: automated deployment, continuous integration, pipeline setup, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, build failing, deploy automatically, CI configuration, release automation.

## Platform Selection

| Stack                        | Recommended                   | Why                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Web (Next.js, Nuxt, static)  | Vercel, Netlify               | Zero-config, auto-deploys, preview URLs  |
| Mobile (iOS/Android/Flutter) | Codemagic, Bitrise + Fastlane | Pre-configured signing, app store upload |
| Backend/Docker               | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI     | Full control, self-hosted runners option |
| Monorepo                     | Nx/Turborepo + GHA            | Affected detection, build caching        |

**Decision tree:** If platform handles deploy automatically (Vercel, Netlify) → skip custom CI. Only add GitHub Actions when you need tests, custom builds, or deploy to your own infra.

## Common Pipeline Pitfalls

| Mistake                   | Impact                         | Fix                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Using `latest` image tags | Builds break randomly          | Pin versions: `node:20.11.0`         |
| Not caching dependencies  | +5-10 min per build            | Cache `node_modules`, `.next/cache`  |
| Secrets in workflow files | Leaked in logs/PRs             | Use platform secrets, OIDC for cloud |
| Missing `timeout-minutes` | Stuck jobs burn budget         | Always set: `timeout-minutes: 15`    |
| No `concurrency` control  | Redundant runs on rapid pushes | Group by branch/PR                   |
| Building on every push    | Wasted resources               | Build on push to main, test on PRs   |

## Mobile-Specific: Code Signing

The #1 pain point. iOS requires certificates + provisioning profiles. Android requires keystores.

**The fix:** Use **Fastlane Match** — stores certs/profiles in git repo, syncs across team and CI.

```bash
# One-time setup
fastlane match init
fastlane match appstore

# In CI
fastlane match appstore --readonly
```

For detailed mobile CI/CD patterns (iOS, Android, Flutter), see `mobile.md`.

## Web-Specific: Build Caching

Next.js/Nuxt builds are slow without cache. The `No Cache Detected` warning = full rebuild.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions: persist Next.js cache
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .next/cache
    key: nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

For framework-specific configs, see `web.md`.

## Debugging Failed Builds

| Error Pattern              | Likely Cause                  | Check                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Works locally, fails in CI | Environment drift             | Node version, env vars, OS     |
| Intermittent failures      | Flaky tests, resource limits  | Retry logic, increase timeout  |
| `ENOENT` / file not found  | Build order, missing artifact | Check `needs:` dependencies    |
| Exit code 137              | Out of memory                 | Use larger runner or optimize  |
| Certificate/signing errors | Expired or mismatched creds   | Regenerate with Match/Fastlane |
